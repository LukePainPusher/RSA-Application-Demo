## Usage

This application has been developed to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of the RSA encryption algorithm.
 By using my knowledge and skills in the Python programming language/RSA encryption, I have been able to develop an application with the assistance of ChatGPT.
This application is not designed to be used in production, but as a tool to further develop your understanding of the algorithm and its importance in maintaining data integrity within an untrusted network.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository using a Bash terminal (either GitBash https://gitforwindows.org/ or a Unix-based Bash terminal with Git commands installed)
git clone https://github.com/LukePainPusher/RSA-Application-Demo.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd \path\to\python\application

# Install dependencies
py -m pip install pycryptodome

# Note, that the 'pycryptodome' package is required to be installed in order to run this application.  (This package provides the means to encrypt
# and decrypt the data).
